Hi, I'm Dave Berning, a web developer and author from Cincinnati. Yeah, *the* Queen City, where we smother spaghetti with chili and say things like "ope" and "I'm gonna squeeze right by ya." Anyway...

I've been a front-end web developer for more than ten years. In 2015, I graduated from the University of Cincinnati, where I learned to create interactive websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I build rich single-page web applications with Vue.js and TypeScript.

When I'm not coding, I try to give back to the community where I can. Recently, it's through writing tutorials at [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/users/daveberning) and speaking as the founder/co-organizer at the [CodePen Cincinnati meetups](https://www.meetup.com/CodePen-Cincinnati/). In 2018 I became a published author with *[Vue.js: Understanding It's Tools and Ecosystem](https://www.amazon.com/Vue-Js-Understanding-Its-Tools-Ecosystem/dp/9388425022)* (author) and *[Creating Interfaces With Bulma](https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Interfaces-Bulma-Jeremy-Thomas-ebook/dp/B079M1BJG4/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=creating+interfaces+with+bulma&qid=1566873504&s=books&sr=1-1)* (co-author, co-editor). Go and tell your mom to buy my books, that's how I make money.

You can find me almost anywhere on the World Wide Web as [@daveberning](https://twitter.com/daveberning).
