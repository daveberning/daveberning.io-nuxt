Drees Homes was founded in 1928. Since it's founding, it has grown into a multi-billion dollar private business, building new homes across the United States. I was hired in the fall of 2016 as a front-end developer to build the front-end of their internal applications and maintain the company website.

During my time at Drees Homes, I modernized their front-end stack and created new libraries to expedite development. Some of these technologies I helped adopted and explored are Vue.js, TypeScript, CSS Grid, service workers, Jest, and more.

In addition to development, my responsibilities also included the designing of user interfaces and creating solid user experiences for various department applications like Dream Builder.
