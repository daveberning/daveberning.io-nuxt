  ### My Role


  I was the **tech lead** and **lead front-end developer** on this project. In this role, I was responsible for weekly deployments and development of the company website. As the tech lead, I managed a small group of front-end developers and delegated their tasks as well as my own. Part of our development process was bi-weekly code reviews, which I led to maintain a high coding standard.


  This project is built with Nuxt.js, SCSS, TypeScript, and more. External TypeScript utility functions were tested using Jest with 90% code coverage.

Drees Homes was founded in 1928. Since it's founding, it has grown into a multi-billion dollar private business, building new homes across the United States. I was hired in the fall of 2016 as a front-end developer to build the front-end of their internal applications and maintain the company website.

During my time at Drees Homes, I modernized their front-end stack and created new libraries to expedite development. Some of these technologies I helped adopted and explored are Vue.js, TypeScript, CSS Grid, service workers, Jest, and more.

In addition to development, my responsibilities also included the designing of user interfaces and creating solid user experiences for various department applications like Dream Builder.
