        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>For this project, I was given a robust Figma prototype, complete with branding foundations, atoms, molecules, and more. As the developer, I was tasked to take those mockups and build an interactive experience that is easily maintainable and content-driven by the client. We settled on a JAMStack development model with Prismic as the content management system (CMS) and Nuxt as the front-end library. This project was developed over the span of the three summer months.</p>

        <p>As an employee of Oodle, I was the <strong>developer</strong> of this project. This was a project with a quick
          turnaround time. I worked closely with Oodle designers, project managers, and account executives from development to launch.</p>
